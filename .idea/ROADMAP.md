# Architecture Roadmap

This roadmap defines the evolution of this knowledge base.

It is structured to reflect the real growth path of an engineer
moving from implementation-focused thinking to architecture-level reasoning.

This is not a checklist.
It is a maturity model.

---

# Level 1 — Architectural Foundations

Understanding what architecture truly means.

## 01. Foundations
- What Software Architecture Really Is
- Architecture vs Design
- Coupling vs Cohesion
- Abstraction and Boundaries
- Technical Debt as an Architectural Concern
- Evolutionary Architecture
- Architecture as Risk Management

Goal:
Shift mindset from writing code to shaping systems.

---

# Level 2 — Design Principles & Structural Thinking

Building internal structure with intentional design.

## 02. Design Principles
- SOLID Revisited (beyond definitions)
- Dependency Inversion in Practice
- Clean Architecture
- Hexagonal Architecture
- Domain-Driven Design (Strategic Overview)
- Tactical vs Strategic Design
- Anti-Patterns in Enterprise Systems

Goal:
Design codebases that survive years of evolution.

---

# Level 3 — Architectural Patterns

Understanding macro-structure decisions.

## 03. Architectural Patterns
- Monolith (Modular Monolith)
- Microservices (When and When NOT)
- Event-Driven Architecture
- CQRS
- API Gateway Pattern
- Backend-for-Frontend
- Strangler Fig Pattern
- Layered vs Onion vs Hexagonal
- Service Mesh Overview

Goal:
Make conscious structural decisions based on constraints.

---

# Level 4 — System Design & Scalability

Designing systems under load and uncertainty.

## 04. System Design
- Scalability (Vertical vs Horizontal)
- Load Balancing Strategies
- Caching Strategies (Write-through, Write-back)
- Database Scaling (Sharding, Replication)
- CAP Theorem
- Consistency Models
- Rate Limiting
- Idempotency
- Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Observability Foundations

Goal:
Design systems that operate reliably at scale.

---

# Level 5 — Distributed Systems

Operating across network boundaries.

## 05. Distributed Systems
- Eventual Consistency Deep Dive
- Distributed Transactions
- Saga Pattern
- Outbox Pattern
- Exactly-Once vs At-Least-Once Delivery
- Message Brokers (Conceptual Overview)
- Failure Handling Strategies
- Time and Ordering Problems
- Data Synchronization Strategies

Goal:
Understand that the network is unreliable — and design accordingly.

---

# Level 6 — Cloud & Platform Architecture

Designing for modern infrastructure.

## 06. Cloud Architecture
- Cloud-Native Principles
- Containers & Orchestration
- Serverless Trade-offs
- Infrastructure as Code
- Multi-Region Design
- High Availability Architectures
- Cost-Aware Architecture
- Security in Cloud Systems
- Zero Trust Overview

Goal:
Design systems aligned with modern infrastructure realities.

---

# Level 7 — Quality Attributes & Non-Functional Requirements

Engineering for sustainability.

## 07. Quality Attributes
- Scalability as a Business Requirement
- Reliability & Fault Tolerance
- Observability (Logs, Metrics, Traces)
- Maintainability & Modularity
- Performance Engineering
- Security by Design
- Compliance Considerations
- Chaos Engineering Introduction

Goal:
Design systems beyond functionality.

---

# Level 8 — Architecture Decision & Governance

Making and documenting high-impact decisions.

## 08. Documentation & Decision Records
- ADR (Architecture Decision Record)
- Trade-off Analysis
- Risk Assessment
- Architecture Review Checklist
- Technical RFC Process
- Evolutionary Refactoring Strategy
- Governance without Bureaucracy

Goal:
Make architecture explicit, traceable and defensible.

---

# Level 9 — Case Studies & Applied Architecture

Applying knowledge in realistic scenarios.

## 09. Case Studies
- Designing a Payment System
- Designing a Real-Time Chat
- Scaling an E-commerce Platform
- Building a SaaS Platform from Scratch
- Migrating from Monolith to Microservices
- Designing a Multi-Tenant Architecture

Goal:
Demonstrate applied reasoning and trade-offs.

---

# Level 10 — Architect Mindset & Leadership

Architecture beyond technology.

## 10. Career & Mindset
- Thinking Like an Architect
- Technical Leadership vs Architecture
- Decision-Making Under Uncertainty
- Stakeholder Communication
- Business-Driven Architecture
- Build vs Buy Decisions
- Cost vs Complexity Trade-offs

Goal:
Move from system builder to system strategist.

---

# Future Expansion

Planned Advanced Topics:

- Platform Engineering
- Internal Developer Platforms (IDP)
- AI Systems Architecture
- Edge Computing
- Event Streaming at Scale
- Data Mesh Overview
- FinOps in Architecture
- Architecture for Startups vs Enterprises

---

This roadmap evolves as the industry evolves.
Architecture is not static.
Neither is this repository.
