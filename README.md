## 🪵 The Coding Cabin

Built with care, depth, and long-term thinking.
Welcome to the cabin.

# Everything About Software Architecture & Design

A structured, real-world oriented knowledge base for engineers who want to think beyond code and design scalable, resilient, and maintainable systems.

This repository is not about frameworks.  
It is about decisions.

Created by TheCodingCabin.

## Mission

Software architecture is not about drawing boxes and arrows.  
It is about making irreversible decisions under uncertainty.

This project exists to:

- Bridge the gap between theory and real-world system design
- Document architectural trade-offs clearly and objectively
- Provide structured knowledge for engineers aiming at senior and staff-level roles
- Serve as a long-term architecture playbook

---

## Who Is This For?

- Mid-level engineers aiming for Senior
- Senior engineers preparing for Staff/Principal roles
- Engineers preparing for System Design interviews
- Professionals who want to think in terms of scalability, reliability and trade-offs

This is not an introductory programming repository.

## Philosophy

Architecture is about trade-offs.

There is no perfect system.
There are only systems optimized for specific constraints.

This repository emphasizes:

- Context over hype
- Clarity over complexity
- Trade-offs over dogma
- Evolutionary design over premature optimization

---

## Roadmap

This is a living knowledge base.

New chapters and case studies will be continuously added, including:

- Advanced distributed systems patterns
- Real-world scaling scenarios
- Cloud architecture deep dives
- Architecture decision walkthroughs

---

## How to Use This Repository

You can use this repository as:

- A structured learning path
- A system design interview preparation guide
- A reference during architecture discussions
- A foundation for technical leadership growth

Each chapter is organized to include:

- Problem context
- Core concepts
- Real-world examples
- Trade-offs
- When NOT to use
- Related topics
